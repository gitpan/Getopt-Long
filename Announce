Version 2.20 of module Getopt::Long is now available via CPAN. It
should soon appear in directory authors/Johan_Vromans as file
Getopt-Long-2.20.tar.gz. It will be standard part of Perl 5.005 or later.

Module Getopt::Long implements an extended getopt function called
GetOptions(). This function implements the POSIX standard for command
line options, with GNU extensions, while still capable of handling
the traditional one-letter options (including option bundling).

The README document is attached to this message.

The best way to download from CPAN is to use a Web browser and point
it to http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ (include the final slash!). It will
automagically be redirected to a CPAN site in your neighborhood.

Changes in version 2.20
-----------------------

* Prevent the magic argument "<>" from being interpreted as option
  starter characters if it is the first argument passed.
  To use the characters "<>" as option starters, pass "><" instead.

* Changed license: Getopt::Long may now also be used under the Perl
  Artistic License.

* Changed the file name of the distribution kit from "GetoptLong..."
  to "Getopt-Long-..." to match the standards.

Previous released version was 2.19.
