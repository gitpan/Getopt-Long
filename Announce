Version 2.26 of module Getopt::Long has been released to CPAN. It will
be standard part of Perl 5.8.

Module Getopt::Long implements an extended getopt function called
GetOptions(). This function implements the POSIX standard for command
line options, with GNU extensions, while still capable of handling
the traditional one-letter options (including option bundling).

The README document is attached to this message.
