Version 2.21 of module Getopt::Long is now available via CPAN. It
should soon appear in directory authors/Johan_Vromans as file
Getopt-Long-2.21.tar.gz. It will be standard part of Perl 5.6.

Module Getopt::Long implements an extended getopt function called
GetOptions(). This function implements the POSIX standard for command
line options, with GNU extensions, while still capable of handling
the traditional one-letter options (including option bundling).

The README document is attached to this message.

The best way to download from CPAN is to use a Web browser and point
it to http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ (include the final slash!). It will
automagically be redirected to a CPAN site in your neighborhood.
