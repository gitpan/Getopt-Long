Version 2.33 of module Getopt::Long has been released to CPAN. It will
be standard part of Perl 5.8.1 and 5.9.

Module Getopt::Long implements an extended getopt function called
GetOptions(). This function implements the POSIX standard for command
line options, with GNU extensions, while still capable of handling
the traditional one-letter options (including option bundling).
It adds a lot of features like automatic abbreviation of option names,
aliases and callback functions.

The README document is attached to this message.

The easiest way to get it is by using the CPAN shell:

   perl -MCPAN -e 'install("Getopt::Long")'

Alternatively, use a Web browser and point it to the CPAN search engine:
