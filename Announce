Version 2.23 of module Getopt::Long is now available via CPAN. It
should soon appear in directory authors/Johan_Vromans as file
Getopt-Long-2.23.tar.gz. It will be standard part of Perl 5.6.

Module Getopt::Long implements an extended getopt function called
GetOptions(). This function implements the POSIX standard for command
line options, with GNU extensions, while still capable of handling
the traditional one-letter options (including option bundling).

The README document is attached to this message.

The best way to download from CPAN is to use a Web browser and point
it to http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ (include the final slash!). It will
automagically be redirected to a CPAN site in your neighborhood.

Changes in version 2.23
-----------------------

* When a call-back routine issues 'die', messages starting with "!"
  are treated specially. Currently, only "!FINISH" is recognised (see
  the next bullet point). Other messages that start with "!" are
  ignored.

* Change 'die("FINISH") (see changes in 2.21) to die("!FINISH"). This
  is an incompatible change, but I guess noone is using this yet.

Changes in version 2.22
-----------------------

* Fixes a bug in the combination of aliases and negation.

  Old:  "foo|bar!" allowed negation on foo, but not on bar.
  New:  "foo|bar!" allows negation on foo and bar.

  Caveat: "foo|f!", with bundling, issues the warning that negation on
  a short option is ignored. To obtain the desired behaviour, use

	"foo|f" => $opt_foo, "nofoo" => sub { $opt_foo = 0 }

  Remember that this is _only_ required when bundling is in effect.

Previous released version was 2.22.
